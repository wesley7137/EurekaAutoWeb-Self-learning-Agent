CAN: Summarizing the prompt, the task is to utilize AI to develop an "expert" language and actionable experimentation model for a pre-existing application capable of simulating neural pathways with a virtual brain model. The aim is to enhance the utilization of this application for experimental purposes.

Here's a step-by-step methodology to achieve this:

Understanding the Application:

Get a thorough understanding of the existing application, its capabilities, and limitations concerning neural pathway simulation and virtual brain modeling.
Data Collection and Preparation:

Collect a substantial amount of data from the application which includes various neural pathway simulations and their outcomes.
It's crucial to have a well-structured dataset to train the AI model. The data should include different scenarios, parameters used, and results obtained from the neural pathway simulation application.
Development of Expert Language:

Define an "expert" language that encapsulates the terminology, actions, and outcomes pertinent to neural pathway simulation.
This language should be structured and standardized to ensure clear communication and interpretation of the experimentation model.
Designing the AI Model:

Design an AI model that can interpret the expert language and translate it into actionable inputs for the application.
Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process and interpret the expert language.
The model should also be able to translate the outcomes from the application back into the expert language for analysis.

Integrate the trained AI model with the application, creating a seamless interface for inputting experimental parameters using the expert language and obtaining results.
Development of Actionable Experimentation Model:

Develop an experimentation model that outlines the process of designing, conducting, analyzing, and iterating experiments using the application.
This model should utilize the expert language for communication and be structured to facilitate systematic experimentation and analysis.
Testing and Validation:

Test the integrated AI model and experimentation model with the application to ensure accurate translation, execution, and analysis of experiments.
Validate the system against known outcomes or with domain experts to ensure it meets the desired level of accuracy and utility.
Iterative Improvement:

Create a feature set that encapsulates all the necessary information required for the model to understand and interact with the program effectively.
Labeling and Annotation:

Label the data to create a supervised learning dataset. This might involve annotating the data to identify the correct responses or actions the model should take based on the input.
If the program has predictable outcomes, use these as labels to create a training dataset.
Knowledge Representation:

Create a knowledge base or ontology that encapsulates the expert knowledge from the documentation and lectures. This can be used to guide the training of the model and ensure it aligns with expert understanding.
Data Splitting:
